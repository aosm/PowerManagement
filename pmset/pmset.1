.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
changes and reads power management settings such as idle sleep timing, wake on administrative access, automatic restart on power loss, etc.
.Sh SETTING
The
.Fl a,
.Fl b,
.Fl c,
.Fl u
flags determine whether the settings apply to battery (
.Fl b
),
charger (wall power) (
.Fl c
), UPS (
.Fl u
) or all (
.Fl a
).
.Pp
Use a minutes argument of 0 to set the idle time to never.
.Pp
.Nm
must be run as root in order to modify any settings.
.Pp
The boot argument tells power management that system bootup is complete. Loginwindow handles this on a normal Mac OS X system.

.br
.Ar lessbright
- slightly turn down display brightness when switching to this power source (value = 0/1)
.br
.Ar halfdim
- display sleep will use an intermediate half-brightness state between full brightness and fully off  (value = 0/1)
.br
.Ar sms

.br
.Ar hibernatefile
- change hibernation image file location. Image may only be located on the root volume. Please use caution. (value = path)
.br
.Ar ttyskeepawake
- prevent idle system sleep when any tty (e.g. remote login session) is 'active'. A tty is 'inactive' only when its idle time exceeds the system sleep timer. (value = 0/1)
.Sh SETTINGS PROFILES
Mac OS X stores sets of pre-defined Energy Saver settings in a few numbered profiles (1, 2, 3). 
All user-modified settings are stored in the custom profile (-1). 
The two numbered profiles 0 and 4 are unused.
.Pp
Profiles are set per-power source. Default profile selections are 
.br
(AC=2, Batt=1, UPS=1). See 
.Pa Examples 
for ways to set profiles.
.Pp
Any modifications made to Energy Saver settings via Energy Saver or pmset will automatically switch your active profile to Custom if it was not already Custom. OS X tracks the selected profiles and the settings for the Custom profile in 
.Pa com.apple.PowerManagement.plist
discussed in
.Pa Files
below.
.Pp
.Ar 1
corresponds to Energy Saver Optimization for "Better Energy Savings"
.br
.Ar 2
corresponds to Energy Saver Optimization for "Normal"
.br
.Ar 3
corresponds to Energy Saver Optimization for "Better Performance"
.br
.Ar -1
corresponds to Energy Saver Optimization for "Custom"
.Sh SAFE SLEEP ARGUMENTS
.Ar hibernatemode
takes a bitfield argument defining SafeSleep behavior. Passing 0 disables SafeSleep altogether, forcing the computer into a regular sleep.
.Pp
.Ar 0001 
(bit 0) enables hibernation; causes OS X to write memory state to hibernation image at sleep time. On wake (without bit 1 set) OS X will resume from the hibernation image. Bit 0 set (without bit 1 set) causes OS X to write memory state and immediately hibernate at sleep time.
.Pp
.Ar 0010
(bit 1), in conjunction with bit 0, causes OS X to maintain system state in memory and leave system power on until battery level drops below a near empty threshold (This enables quicker wakeup from memory while battery power is available). Upon nearly emptying the battery, OS X shuts off all system power and hibernates; on wake the system will resume from hibernation image, not from memory. 
.Pp
.Ar hibernatemode 
is set to 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables.
.Pp
.Ar hibernatemode 
is set to 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops.
.Pp
Please note that
.Ar hibernatefile
may only point to a file located on the root volume.
.Sh UPS SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS
.br
UPS-specific arguments are only valid following the 
.Fl u 
option. UPS settings also have an on/off value. Use a -1 argument instead of percent 
or minutes to turn any of these settings off. If multiple halt conditions are specified,
the system will halt on the first condition that occurs in a low power situation.
.Pp
.Ar haltlevel
- when draining UPS battery, battery level at which to trigger an emergency shutdown (value in %)
.br
.Ar haltafter
- when draining UPS battery, trigger emergency shutdown after this long running on UPS power (value in minutes, or 0 to disable)
.br
.Ar haltremain
- when draining UPS battery, trigger emergency shutdown when this much time remaining on UPS power is estimated (value in minutes, or 0 to disable)
.Pp
Note: None of these settings are observed on a system with support for an internal battery, such as a laptop. UPS emergency shutdown settings are for desktop and server only.
.Sh SCHEDULED EVENT ARGUMENTS
.br
pmset allows you to schedule system sleep, shutdown, wakeup and/or power on. "schedule"
is for setting up one-time power events, and "repeat" is for setting up daily/weekly 
power on and power off events. Note that you may only have one pair of repeating events
scheduled - a "power on" event and a "power off" event.
.Pp
.Ar type 
- one of sleep, wake, poweron, shutdown, wakeorpoweron
.br
.Ar date/time
- "MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss" (in 24 hour format; must be in quotes)
.br
.Ar time 
- HH:mm:ss
.br
.Ar weekdays
- a subset of MTWRFSU ("M" and "MTWRF" are valid strings)
.br
.Ar owner 
- a string describing the person or program who is scheduling this one-time power event (optional)
.Sh POWER SOURCE ARGUMENTS
.Fl g 
with a 'batt' or 'ps' argument will show the state of all attached power sources.
A health estimate for the battery is appended to the end of the line, in the form
(Fair/Good), indicating the battery is in 'Fair' health and we have 'Good' confidence
in that estimate.
.Pp
Certain Apple battery calibration tools may temporarily disable battery charging, 
even though your Apple portable is plugged into AC power. Such tools will never
surprise you with this behavior; you will know it's happening. This state will be 
reflected in an additional line of output to 'batt' or 'ps' readings, including the pid of the app inducing
this behavior. 
.Pp
    'ChargeInhibit':    1432
.Pp
.Fl g 
with a 'pslog' or 'rawlog' argument is normally used for debugging, such as isolating
a problem with an aging battery.
.Sh OTHER ARGUMENTS
.Ar boot 
- tell the kernel that system boot is complete (normally LoginWindow does this). May be useful to Darwin users.
.br
.Ar force 
- tells PM to immediately activate these settings. Does not write them to disk, and the settings may easily be overwritten. Useful in circumstances where PM's configd plugin happens not to be running.
.br
.Ar touch
- PM re-reads existing settings from disk.
.br
.Ar noidle
- while continuousy running, pmset prevents idle sleep.
.br
.Ar sleepnow
- causes an immediate system sleep
.br
.Ar dim 
- deprecated in 10.4 in favor of 'displaysleep'. 'dim' will continue to work.
.br
.Ar spindown 
- deprecated in 10.4 in favor of 'disksleep'. 'spindown' will continue to work.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This command sets displaysleep to a 5 minute timer on battery power, leaving
other settings on battery power and other power sources unperturbed.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl b
displaysleep 5
.Pp
Sets displaysleep to 10, disksleep to 10, system sleep to 30, and
turns on WakeOnMagicPacket for ALL power sources (AC, Battery, and UPS) as appropriate
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl a
displaysleep 10 disksleep 10 sleep 30 womp 1
.Pp
Restores the system's energy settings to their default values. Any user modifications are preserved under the custom profile -1.
.Pp
.Nm
-c 2 -b 1 -u 1
.Pp
Changes energy settings for all power sources to the Custom settings set via pmset or Energy Saver.
.Pp
.Nm
-a -1
.Pp
For a system with an attached and supported UPS, this instructs the system to
perform an emergency shutdown when UPS battery drains to below 40%.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl u
haltlevel 40
.Pp
For a system with an attached and supported UPS, this instructs the system to
perform an emergency shutdown when UPS battery drains to below 25%, or when the
UPS estimates it has less than 30 minutes remaining runtime. The system shuts down
as soon as either of these conditions is met.
.Pp
.Nm

.Pp
If your system suddenly sleeps on battery power with 20-50% of capacity remaining, leave this command running in a Terminal window. When you see the problem and later power and wake the
computer, you'll be able to detect sudden discontinuities (like a jump from 30% to 0%) indicative of an aging battery.
